# "In the End" player for Raspberry Pi (WIP)

This work-in-progress project will run on a Raspberry Pi and will play the chorus from "In the End" by Linkin Park when the song's intro is played on a connected MIDI device. You can see me demoing the script on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tylerlwsmith/status/1327802206020464640). The demo prints to the console, but the final project will play the chorus through connected speakers.

I built this project in November 2020, and I'm resuming development in November 2021. This was the first Python project I ever built, so it didn't even use a virtual environment. I will soon add either `venv` or Docker for development, and an Ansible playbook for installing the project on a fresh Pi.
